# Capstone Project â€“ eboVar: A Bash Pipeline for EBOV Variant Profiling and Analysis (Group 3)

## Description

This capstone project challenges participants to design and implement a comprehensive bioinformatics pipeline for analyzing raw Illumina sequencing data of Ebola virus isolates. The project emphasizes command-line scripting, data manipulation, variant calling, data wrangling and analysis, and containerization for reproducibility.

### Tools used in the pipeline
1. FastQC         - quality check of raw reads
2. fastp          - trimming and filtering
3. MultiQC        - reporting
4. BWA            - Alignment
5. Samtools
6. BCFtools
