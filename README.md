# Capstone Project – eboVar: A Bash Pipeline for EBOV Variant Profiling and Analysis (Group 3)

## Description

This capstone project challenges participants to design and implement a comprehensive bioinformatics pipeline for analyzing raw Illumina sequencing data of Ebola virus isolates. The project emphasizes command-line scripting, data manipulation, variant calling, data wrangling and analysis, and containerization for reproducibility.

### Tools used in the pipeline
1. FastQC         - quality check of raw reads
2. fastp          - trimming and filtering
3. MultiQC        - reporting
4. BWA            - Alignment
5. Samtools
6. BCFtools


---

⚙ Pipeline Steps

The pipeline (eboVar.sh) performs:

1. Step 1: FastQC on raw reads

2. Trimming with fastp

3. FastQC on trimmed reads

4. Alignment with BWA

5. Index BAM

6. Variant calling: bcftools

7. Sort + index VCF

🚀 How to Run

📥 Clone repository & prepare

git clone https://github.com/<your_username>/Capstone_EboVar.git
cd Capstone_EboVar

✅ Run locally with conda

conda env create -f containers/ebovar.yml
conda activate ebovar

bash scripts/eboVar.sh -i data/raw -o results -r data/reference/ebov_ref.fa -t 4


---

📦 Containerized workflow

Build Apptainer container

apptainer build containers/ebovar.sif containers/ebovar.def

Run pipeline inside container

apptainer run containers/ebovar.sif -i data/raw -o results -r data/reference/ebov_ref.fa -t 4
